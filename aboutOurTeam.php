                        Growing up Maggie and Nick were intertwined with different entrepreneur ventures by their parents. They 
                        have been born and raised in amazing the O'Fallon, IL community for their whole lives. Throughout high school 
                        they would pet sit for friends and family which came as second nature because they both grew up with 
                        FurBabies of their own. After graduating from OTHS in 2019 a simple post on Facebook quickly showed how 
                        much the community desired a Pet Sitting company. So on July 11, Maggie and Nick made Pawsitively Happy 
                        Pet Services official. In 2020, they decided to grow their business in a new way by bringing on their 
                        first team member which gave them an opportunity to help even more families at one time. Since then they 
                        have been blessed in the amount of support and trust from their clients and community.

                            Growing up with many FurBabies in my home, you could say that I have been in the business my whole life. 
                            I am a 9th Generation resident to St Clair County and a 6th generation to O'Fallon. I am a graduate of 
                            O'Fallon Township High School in 2019 and I am a graduate of Southwestern Illinois College with an 
                            Associate in Arts and an Associate in Science. I am currently attending Barnes-Jewish Goldfarb School of

                            <br>
                            I am a proud FurBaby mom of 3 (Benjamin, Coco, and Rudy) and I understand the needs of busy families. 
                            Having our community's interest at heart, I have assisted in Wreaths Across America, which is an 
                            organization dedicated to honoring our military veteran's history. We place wreaths on veteran's headstones. 
                            I am a full-time student and pet sitter. 
                            <br>
                            I am proud to be a part of our community and would not change being a pet sitter for the world. I am proud

                            I have owned multiple FurBabies throughout my life: the best dog and bunny ever, Forrest and Hazel! 
                            Forrest is a Beagle/Pitbull Mix and is very energetic and loving. Hazel is a tri colored Holland lop 
                            (black, brown, and white) and loves her belly rubbed.

                            I have been taking care of others' FurBabies since 2017. Personally, I have experience with taking care of 
                            dogs, cats, birds, hamsters, turtles, fish, geckos, lizards, guinea pigs, bunnies, snakes, and horses. I do 
                            not have experience with ferrets, or hedgehogs, but I look forward to working with them!
